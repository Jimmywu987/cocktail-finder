## Decisions I made on this project

A hamburger is used on the width of mobile version despite the dark mode toggle has enough space, because it is much easier for future website expension as more potential links can be added in the future development.

-------------------
As I was not familiar with using Scss before, I wanted to explore more on using Scss, therefore I have added Dark mode feature on this project to give it a try.

--------------------
The reasons I used drop down menu for alphabet options display
1. If all alphabets were displayed on the page, there maybe more noise for the user to look at the content.
2. The width of the screen isn't enoguh to hold all alphabets horizontally as one line, or if flex wrap is used to pile the alphabets on top of one another. The look maybe a bit compact and user may have a relatively not easy time to click on the right alphabet.

-------------------
A drink detail page is added for a more complete display, not only for description, but the ingredients as well as the measures.
